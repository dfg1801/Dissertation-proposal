## Chapter 1 - Historic range reconstruction

### **Intro**

The modern range of the Hawaiʻian honeycreepers is severely constricted by anthropogenic forces. Habitat destruction, avian malaria, and invasive species, to name a few, have pushed most honeycreeper populations to extinction or to higher elevation habitats. [@callicrate2014][@guillaumet2017] These antropogenic range shifts confound biogeograpic analyses, making it impossible to truly measure the strength of biogeographic effects on this radiation.

The numerous ornithological expeditions to the Hawaiʻian islands produced many written accounts and museum specimens. While the honeycreeper ranges were certainly already constricted then, many of these data were still collected before the mass extinctions of the early 1900s, due to the introduction of avian malaria to the islands. [@samuel2015a][@warner1968] Many of the specimens' tag info are available on online databases, such as iDigBio, and written accounts are available through early publications like *Aves Hawaiienses : the birds of the Sandwich Islands.*[@wilson1890]

In addition, there is much pre-western contact indigenous knowledge of the honeycreepers. These forest birds hold strong cultural significance, as they were hunted a source of food and for their feathers. [@gomes2020] There has been much work in the last century to preserve native Hawaiʻian knowledge, culture, and text. Many digitized documents remain largely unexplored for honeycreeper range data. Though this type of information is often passed over by western science due to difficulty integrating it into western scientific frameworks (language barriers, different taxonomic understanding, etc), leaning into these challenges opens up opportunities for inter-disciplinary collaboration. Working to collate and integrate indigenous Hawaiian knowledge will not only help to bolster range data, but provide a case study to utilizing indigenous knowledge.

The true, pre-human ranges of the Hawaʻian honeycreepers are lost to time, but fragments of information can help us to recreate these undisturbed ranges. Working backwards through time through multiple information sources will garner enough info to reconstruct the historic ranges of the honeycreepers. This work can inform conservation efforts to answer questions like which areas are most relevant for restoration, possibly identifying candidate sites which may have been overlooked because of lack of evidence of bird habitation.

### **Methods**

Pull info from museum specimen logs, fossil data, as well as from verbal accounts (capt. cook etc) and nupepaa accounts + possibly combine with modern ebird data

-   take museum specimen data from idigbio,

    -   need to clean + inspect entries with missing info (using other papers) such as...

    -   XY coord data

    -   dates

    -   collectors

-   then do weighted reconstruction (?), with more weight on older accounts? bayesian multi-info integration?

Depending on how good the data turns out, either develop maps or use niche modeling techniques

### **Nupepa analysis**

From just searching the bird names 995 hits

-   Many are repeat entries though, especially the older entries

-   Seems like there may not be much spatial information

Translations start from about the 1980s, previous text is untranslated

-   Can get general idea of translation from using google translate + dictionary

-   Older text digital transcriptions often have errors

**PROS**: 

-   Would help to integrate an underutilized source of information

-   Potentially interesting statistical approaches for integrating these different data streams

**CONS**: 

-   Difficult because I don’t speak olelo 

-   Limited geographic info 

**PLAN:**

-   Find undergrad interested in ʻōlelo Hawaiʻi and also biology/CS to assist in data collection

-   Find collaborator who knows about biocultural practice, ʻōiwi knowledge

-   Curate data with CARE principles 

-   Once data are collected, integrate with survey data (e.g. eBird), museum collections, etc to create range maps

-   **DELIVERABLE:** manuscript presenting best inference of pre-contact ranges 

-   Key personnel: 

    -   Noelani Puniwai–professor Hawaiʻinuiākea, biocultural expert 

    -   Mehana Vahn–professor NREM, biocultural expert, also uses moʻolelo for conservation applications

    -   Kahanuola Tabor–professor Hawaiian Language, could be interested in collab, or at least help find undergrads 

    -   Noah Gomes - UH Hilo Phd student? [Pilina project](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/7ab539af97314852b1d68249797b1297)

    -   Healoha Johnston–Bishop, feather work

    -   Marquez Marcan–Bishop, feather work

    -   Leah Pualahaʻole Caldeira - bishop museum library and archive collection manager

### **Creating a finer resolution occurrence dataset using Ebird**

Combine with Nupepa analysis to add higher spatial resolution 

Use maxent to do pairwise occurrence (logOR) given data we have from ebird and previous range data

-   More refined way of determining which species co-occur

    -   Calculate estimate and confidence around estimate rather than just base range overlap

-   Numerical way of combining different data sources

-   Probably can do with a single clade within honeycreepers - like iiwi and sisters or something - that have more extant species 

    -   Can tell us about how competition and niche partitioning influenced the crazy beak morphos of this clade

-   Older surveys perhaps locality eror?

-   Survey still ongoing 

Does the community structure predict the occurrence of a focal species? 

-   Tying in conservation issues

    -   Birds are going extinct in habitats they should be in

<!-- -->

-   Maybe because of biotic factors? 

    -   Well yes for sure bc of avian malaria but other stuff too?

Perhaps look at how niche space is being filled in with introduced birds? Relate with modern community compo form ebird

-   Think of morpho onslaught of introduced birds!

<!-- -->

-   Older papers about which introduced birds would stick? 

    -   Forgot which one, but shows that introduced birds have higher prob of becoming resident if they fulfill a niche not currently occupied

**PROS**: 

-   Free! 

**CONS**: 

-   Possibly inaccurate, uneven sampling 

-   Not applicable for species that went extinct a longer time ago (like akialoas)

**PLAN:**

-   Pull and clean data from eBird, look into Cornell Lab for cleaning methods

-   Make species distribution models in combination with other data:

    -   Museum records

    -   Field notes

        -   Pyle

        -   Perkins

    -   nūpepa/moʻolelo

        -   Look into Gomesʻs work with kanaka maoli historians 

-   **DELIVERABLES:**

    -   Same as nūpepa/moʻolelo 

    -   Possibly distinct deliverable is detailed info on fine scale co-occurrence (could be separate deliverable cause could go into different downstream analysis)

-   Key personnel

    -   Allen Allison–Bishop, fieldnotes, surveys entered into eBird, midden material, occurrence records at museum generally 

    -   Noah Gomes for kanaka maoli historians 

## Chapter 2 - either pop gen or beak morpho measurements

## Chapter 3 - eco-biogeo analysis
